Summarizer for anvi&#x27;o pan or profile db&#x27;s. Essentially, this program takes a collection id along with either a profile database and a contigs database or a pan database and a genomes storage and generates a static HTML output for what is described in a given collection. The output directory will contain almost everything any downstream analysis may need, and can be displayed using a browser without the need for an anvi&#x27;o installation. For this reason alone, reporting summary outputs as supplementary data with publications is a great idea for transparency and reproducibility.

See **[program help menu](../../../vignette#anvi-summarize)** or go back to the **[main page](../../)** of anvi'o programs and artifacts.
