Explanation of files in seqid.all_in_one.zip,
where seqid is a number assigned by RaptorX to the query sequence
-----------------------------------------------------------------

0README         : This README file.

seqid.fasta     : The user input sequence in FASTA format.

seqid.domain    : Domain boundary and assignment for each residue. Segments marked by 0 are not modeled.

seqid.pdb       : The predicted model for the whole sequence in PDB format.

seqid.png       : The image of the predicted model for the whole sequence in PNG format.

labeling/       : The folder contains the following files.
  seqid.ss3     : 3-class secondary structure prediction 
  seqid.ss8     : 8-class secondary structure prediction 
  seqid.diso    : disorder prediction
  seqid.acc     : solvent accessibility (ACC) prediction

domX/           : The folder contains all results for the X-th domain where X is the domain number.
  pdbs/         : The subfolder for predicted 3D models.
  alignments/   : The subfolder for the alignments/scores.
  ModelRank.rtf : The ranking of the predicted models in pdbs/


In this package, except the image file, all the other files can be opened by WordPad on Windows or vi on Linux.
