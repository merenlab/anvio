            argument, ('gene', ). 'reaction' and 'metabolite' can also be provided in a tuple
            argument (e.g., ('reaction', ) or ('metabolite', 'reaction', 'gene')) to likewise record
            in which bins the reaction and metabolite entries occur. To not record bins at all, pass
            either an empty tuple or None.

        contigs_db : str, None
            Path to a contigs database. The database can represent different types of samples,

            gene KO annotations stored in the database. If 'store' is True, the network is saved in
            the database.

        pan_db : str, None
            Path to a pan database. The pangenomic network is determined for gene clusters stored in
            the database. If 'store' is True, the network is saved in the database.
            An argument for the paired 'genomes_storage_db' is also required.

        genomes_storage_db : str, None
            Path to a genomes storage database. The pangenomic network is derived from gene KO
            annotations stored in the database. An argument for the paired 'pan_db' is also
            required.

        store : bool, True
            Save the network. A network constructed from a contigs database is stored in that
            database. A pangenomic network constructed from a genomes stroage database and pan
            database is stored in the pan database.

        overwrite_existing_network : bool, False
            Overwrite an existing network stored in the contigs or pan database. 'store' is also
            required.

        consensus_threshold : float, None
            This parameter applies to pangenomes. With the default of None, the protein annotation
            most frequent among genes in a cluster is assigned to the cluster itself. If a
            non-default argument is provided (a value on [0, 1]), at least this proportion of genes
            in the cluster must have the most frequent annotation for the cluster to be annotated.

        discard_ties : bool, False
            This parameter applies to pangenomes. If multiple protein annotations are most frequent
            among genes in a cluster, then do not assign an annotation to the cluster itself when
            this argument is True. By default, this argument is False, so one of the most frequent
            annotations would be arbitrarily chosen.

        Parameters
        ==========
        pan_db : str
            Path to a pan database. The pangenomic network is determined for gene clusters stored in
            the database.

        genomes_storage_db : str
            Path to a genomes storage database. The pangenomic network is derived from gene KO
            annotations stored in the database.

        consensus_threshold : float, None
            With the default of None, the protein annotation most frequent among genes in a cluster
            is assigned to the cluster itself. If a non-default argument is provided (a value on [0,
            1]), at least this proportion of genes in the cluster must have the most frequent
            annotation for the cluster to be annotated.

        discard_ties : bool, False
            If multiple protein annotations are most frequent among genes in a cluster, then do not
            assign an annotation to the cluster itself when this argument is True. By default, this
            argument is False, so one of the most frequent annotations would be arbitrarily chosen.
