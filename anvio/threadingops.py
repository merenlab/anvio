class ThreadedCommandRunner(abc.ABC):
    """An abstract class for making mutlithreaded command runners.

    Overview
    ========

    It abstracts the process of making embarrassingly parallel (
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel) types of command runners.  E.g., splitting an input file,
    running a command on all the splits, and then collating the results.

    This class provides default implementations of certain methods, but feel free to override them to meet your needs!

    Some methods are abstract and must be given a concrete implementation in all subclasses.  Abstract methods that you
    must implement include:
        - _split_input_file: method for splitting the input file
        - _make_commands: method for making the actual commands to run
        - _collate_output_files: method for collating any output files

    See `ThreadedProdigalRunner` for an example of a concrete implementation of this interface.

    See the `run` method for how work gets done.  One thing to note is that any method that is called by the `run`
    method should return `State`.  This can be empty (but shouldn't be None).  This provides a convenient way to get
    any state out of the runner object into the caller.  You could then use this info for logging, debugging,
    returning info from parsing output files, etc.

    See individual method docstrings for guidelines on how to implement abstract methods or override existing
    concrete implementations.

    Things to keep in mind:
        - This is an abstact class (with some default implementations), so it's not meant to be used directly.  You
          should subclass it for each particular command you want to run!  See
          `anvio.drivers.prodigal.MultithreadedProdigalRunner` for an example.
        - For now, it only handles the case where a single input file needs to be spilt.
        - If you only want a single thread/split, it will go through the whole process of "splitting" the input file
          into a single split, running the command in a thread, and collating the single output.  It sounds wasteful,
          but in my tests, it generally doesn't make that much difference in the total runtime, as you would only be
          using this class for commands that take a long time to run anyway.  (Or else why bother splitting them up?)

    Parameters
    ==========

    See __init__ definition for expected types!

    - `input_file_path`: Path to file to split and run the commands on.
    - `collated_output_file_paths`: Mapping of output file name (key) to output file path (value).  The key is for
       referencing in the code, and won't be reflected in the filesystem.  Some software you want to run will output
       more than one important file, so The mapping allows you to specify the location of multiple outfiles.
       E.g., {'peptide_path': '/path/to/peptides.faa', 'gff_path': '/path/to/file.gff'}.
    - `log_file_path`: Path to the logfile (e.g., '/path/to/logs.txt')
    - `number_of_splits`: How many splits do you want?  Keep it reasonable: a `Thread` will be spawned for each split.
    - `logger`: a `anvio.terminal.Logger`.  Let's the commands access anvio's nice logging.
