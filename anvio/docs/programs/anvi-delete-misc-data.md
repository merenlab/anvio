After you've added misc-data of some kind (%(misc-data-items)s, %(misc-data-layers)s, %(misc-data-layer-orders)s, %(misc-data-nucleotides)s, or %(misc-data-amino-acids)s) using %(anvi-import-misc-data)s, you can **delete that data and remove it from the interactive interface** using this program. 

This program will release your data into the either, never to be seen again. If you would like to first export it into a text file (so that it can be seen again), you can do so with %(anvi-export-misc-data)s.
