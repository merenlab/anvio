This program uses a %(gene-taxonomy-txt)s to populate the taxonomic information for the genes in a %(contigs-db)s. 

There is an entire blogpost about different ways to do this [here](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/18/importing-taxonomy/). It outlines how to get your sequences using %(anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-calls)s than use either [Kaiju](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/kaiju) or [Centrifuge](https://github.com/infphilo/centrifuge) to get the taxonomy information for your genes. Finally, you bring that information back into anvi'o using this program.
