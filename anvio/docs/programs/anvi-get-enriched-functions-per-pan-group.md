Hi :) As of `v7`, this program is now deprecated. Instead, there is a more general version of this program that can compute functional enrichment scores in a few different scenarios, including pangenomes. See %(anvi-compute-functional-enrichment)s for details. But it was nice to see you here anyway :)
