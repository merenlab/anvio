This program **associates genes in your %(contigs-db)s with functions using the EBI's [Pfam database](https://pfam.xfam.org/).** 

Before you run this program, you'll have to set up the Pfam database on your computer with the program %(anvi-setup-pfams)s.  

The Pfam database is based on protein sequences, so anvi'o will convert your genetic information into protein sequences and then use HMMs to compare them to the database.

To run, you'll need to provide a %(contigs-db)s. If you stored the %(pfams-data)s that you got from running %(anvi-setup-pfams)s in a custom location, you'll need to provide that path as well. The output is a %(functions)s artifact. 

Here is a default run: 

{{ codestart }}
anvi-run-ncbi-cogs -c %(contigs-db)s \
            --pfam-data-dir %(pfams-data)s 
{{ codestop }}

By default, this uses `hmmsearch` to run HMMs. You can choose to use `hmmscan` instead by running

{{ codestart }}
anvi-run-ncbi-cogs -c %(contigs-db)s \
            --pfam-data-dir %(pfams-data)s \
            --hmmer-program hmmscan
{{ codestop }}

See [this article](https://cryptogenomicon.org/2011/05/27/hmmscan-vs-hmmsearch-speed-the-numerology/) for a discussion on the performance of the two HMMER programs.
