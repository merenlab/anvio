This program can use an anvi'o %(clustering-configuration)s file to access various data sources in anvi'o databases to produce a hierarchical clustering dendrogram for items.

It is especially powerful when the user wishes to create a hierarchical clustering of contigs or gene clusters using only a specific set of samples. If you would like to see an example usage of this program see the article on [combining metagenomics with metatranscriptomics](https://merenlab.org/2015/06/10/combining-omics-data/).
