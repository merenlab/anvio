This program outputs a file that denotes which contigs and splits are part of which %(collection-txt)s files. This just tells you which collections each of your contigs are a part of, which can be imported as  acategorical layer with %(anvi-import-misc-data)s. 

This is not super useful, but it is used in the Infant gut tutorial [here](http://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/#comparing-multiple-binning-approaches).
