This is the output of %(anvi-export-splits-taxonomy)s. It is in the same format as a %(gene-taxonomy-txt)s, namely the first column identifies splits and the following columns describe the taxonomy hit associated with that split. 

For example:

    split_id  t_domain     t_phylum       t_class      ...
    1         Eukarya      Chordata       Mammalia
    2         Prokarya     Bacteroidetes  Bacteroidia
    ...
