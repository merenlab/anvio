This is a section of your %(contigs-db)s that contains custom additional information about specific amino acid residues. 

Take a look at [this blogpost](http://merenlab.org/2020/07/22/interacdome/#6-storing-the-per-residue-binding-frequencies-into-the-contigs-database) for potential uses in the InteracDome (which will likely be added to anvi'o in v7) and the motivation behind this program. 

Similarly to other types of miscellaneous data (like %(misc-data-items)s), this information is either numerical or categorical and can be populated into a %(contigs-db)s (from a %(misc-data-amino-acids-txt)s) with %(anvi-import-misc-data)s. It is also displayed with you run %(anvi-show-misc-data)s and can be exported or deleted with %(anvi-export-misc-data)s and %(anvi-delete-misc-data)s respectively. 

For example, this could describe specific residues that are known to be SAAVs, various key residues for binding to ligands, or residues otherwise essential for the structure of the translated protein.
