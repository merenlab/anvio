This is the section of your %(profile-db)s/%(pan-db)s that contains custom additional information about the order that your layers are displayed in and the tree that relates them to each other . When you run %(anvi-interactive)s, this data will determine what order the concentric circles are dispalyed in, as well as the tree that appears above the %(misc-data-layers)s graphs.

As also defined in [this blog post](http://merenlab.org/2017/12/11/additional-data-tables/#views-items-layers-orders-some-anvio-terminology), this type of data will include information about how your layers are related to each other and determines their order. This data is stored as a tree that is displayed in the top-right. 

For example, you could use this tree to indicate and group together samples that came from the same geographic location, samples that came from the same donor, samples of the same type, or samples collected with the same collection method, and so on.
