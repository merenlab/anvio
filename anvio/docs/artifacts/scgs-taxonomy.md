This contains the taxonomy annotions for each of the single-copy core genes found in your %(contigs-db)s; in other words, this contains the results of a run of %(anvi-run-scg-taxonomy)s. 

This information was found through the [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) database, so it will not work with Eukaryotic genomes. 

This information allows you to quickly estimate the taxonomy of genomes, metagenomes, or bins stored in your contigs-db by using the command %(anvi-estimate-scg-taxonomy)s.
