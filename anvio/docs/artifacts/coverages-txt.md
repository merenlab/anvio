This is a text file containing **the average coverage for each contig in each sample** that was in the %(profile-db)s and %(contigs-db)s that you used when you ran %(anvi-export-splits-and-coverages)s. 

This is a tab-delimited file where each row describes a specific contig and each column describes one of your samples. Each cell contains the average coverage of that contig in that sample. 

This artifact is really only used when taking information out of anvi'o, so enjoy your coverage information :)
