A metapangenome is a way of comparing a bunch of genomes based both on the gene clusters they contain (like in a pangenome) and their abundances in different environments/samples (using metagenomic read recruitment).

Here is a [wonderful workflow](http://merenlab.org/data/prochlorococcus-metapangenome/) that takes you through the analysis of 31 *Prochlorococcus* isolate genomes and 93 TARA Oceans metagenomes, based on [this paper](https://peerj.com/articles/4320/).
