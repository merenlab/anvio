A genes database is a %(profile-db)s that also contains all of the gene-level statistics (such as coverage and detection). This is the output of the program %(anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases)s, which will generate one of these per %(bin)s in the %(collection)s you input. 

As such, you can use this as an input anywhere a %(profile-db)s is asked for. See that page for more information.
