## What is this thing?

This is a comprehensive database of protein structures downloaded from the PDB RSCB that are
non-redundant. Currently, it is used for those who want to run %(anvi-gen-structure-database)s
without an internet connection.

## Where does it come from?

A %(pdb-db)s can be created via the program %(anvi-setup-pdb-database)s. Alternatively, a %(pdb-db)s
that contains custom structures not found in the [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) can in theory be
generated by the user, but anvi'o currrently offers no reasonable way of doing this.

## Notes

The %(pdb-db)s generated via %(anvi-setup-pdb-database)s is ~20GB.
