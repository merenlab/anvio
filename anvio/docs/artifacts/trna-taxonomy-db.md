This artifact represents the [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) data (from [Parks et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4229)) downloaded by %(anvi-setup-trna-taxonomy)s. This information is required to run %(anvi-run-trna-taxonomy)s and %(anvi-estimate-trna-taxonomy)s. 

{:.notice}
If the results from this tRNA taxonomy search end up in a paper, make sure to cite [Parks et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4229) for their information.

By default, it is stored at `anvio/data/misc/TRNA-TAXONOMY`. This directory contains a few files for each anticodon, each forming a fancy search database so that you can associate tRNA reads in your %(contigs-db)s with taxonomy information.
