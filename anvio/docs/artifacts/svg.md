SVG stands for scalable vector graphics, which is a vector-based image format. In anvi'o programs that give you pretty-looking outputs will also give you an svg, so you can look at the beauty of your data without having to open anvi'o for analysis. This also makes it easier to share with others (so you don't have to use screenshots in your poster).

As of now, %(anvi-display-contigs-stats)s, %(anvi-display-pan)s, and %(anvi-interactive)s will give you an svg output every time you click the little save button at the bottom-left corner of the settings panel in the interface. You can even customize the location of that output using the flag `--export-svg`. 

Take a look at [this blogpost](http://merenlab.org/2016/10/27/high-resolution-figures/) for an outline of how to get this svg file into a publication-quality figure.
