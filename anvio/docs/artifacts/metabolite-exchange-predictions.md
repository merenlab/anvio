This page describes the output files produced by the program %(anvi-predict-metabolic-exchanges)s. Breifly, the most important outputs of this program are:

- a file of 'potentially-exchanged compounds' (filename suffix: `-potentially-exchanged-compounds.txt`)
- a file of 'unique compounds' (filename suffix: `-unique-compounds.txt`)

If you ran the prediction method that uses KEGG Pathway Map walks to examine chains of reactions leading to the production reactions (or away from the consumption reactions) of a given compound, then you will get an additional output file:

- a file of evidence supporting the predictions of 'potentially-exchanged compounds' from Pathway Map walks

## Example output files

All of the examples shown here were generated by running %(anvi-predict-metabolic-exchanges)s on the genomes of _Baumannia cicadellinicola_ and _Sulcia muelleri_, which are known to exchange amino acids and vitamins as part of their co-symbiosis within the glassy-winged sharpshooter ([Wu et al, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040188)).

### Potentially-exchanged compounds

Each line of this file describes a metabolite that is potentially exchanged between two organisms. For each prediction, it describes which genomes are involved, which organism is the predicted producer and consumer, and the prediction method. If the Pathway Walk prediction method was run, then the file will also contain a basic summary of the evidence supporting each prediction.

Below are the column descriptions.

**Standard columns**
- `compound_id`: the ModelSEED ID of the potentially-exchanged compound
- `compound_name`: the human-readable name of the compound
- `genomes`: which genomes are involved in the potential exchange (labeled by the name set in the %(contigs-db)s)
- `produced_by`: which genome(s) encode enzymes for reactions that produce the compound
- `consumed_by`: which genome(s) encode enzymes for reactions that consume the compound
- `prediction_method`: how did we identify this exchange? By walking over KEGG Pathway Maps or by isolating metabolites in the merged reaction network?

**Supporting evidence columns**

These columns summarize the 'best' evidence we could find that this compound is potentially-exchanged from KEGG Pathway Map walks. By 'best', we mean that we report the longest production chain of reactions in the 'producer' organism and the longest consumption chain of reactions in the 'consumer'. Longer reaction chains indicate that the compound transfer is not isolated within either genome's reaction network; i.e., it is part of a more extensive chain of chemical transformations. When there are two reaction chains with the same maximum length, we report the one with the smallest (real number) proportion of overlap between the two genomes, and when _those_ values are also the same between two chains, we report the one with the smallest (real number) overlap length. If multiple Pathway Maps have chains of exactly the same length _and_ overlap proportion _and_ overlap length, then we report all of them. Note that a lot of these evidence columns can have `None` values in them, which means that the evidence did not apply to a particular case.

- `max_reaction_chain_length`: The total length of the longest production and consumption reaction chains (`max_production_chain_length` + `max_consumption_chain_length`)
- `max_production_chain_length`: The length of the longest production chain in the 'producer' organism
- `production_overlap_length`: If the 'consumer' organism has enzymes that belong to the Pathway Map containing the production chain, then how long is the overlap between the 'consumer' organism's production chains for the compound and the producer's production chain? If this is `None`, it means the 'consumer' didn't have any production chains for the compound and we couldn't compute an overlap.
- `production_overlap_proportion`: If there was overlap between the production chains in the producer and consumer, what proportion of reactions were found in both organisms?
- `production_chain_pathway_map`: The ID(s) of the KEGG Pathway Map in which we found the "best" production chain. If there are multiple Pathway Maps in a comma-separated list here, it means they all included a production chain with the same (maximum) length, (minimum) overlap proportion, and (minimum) overlap length.
- `max_consumption_chain_length`: The length of the longest consumption chain in the 'consumer' organism
- `consumption_overlap_length`: If the 'producer' organism has enzymes that belong to the Pathway Map containing the consumption chain, then how long is the overlap between the 'producer' organism's consumption chains for the compound and the consumer's production chain? If this is `None`, it means the 'producer' didn't have any consumption chains for the compound and we couldn't compute an overlap.
- `consumption_overlap_proportion`: If there was overlap between the consumption chains in the producer and consumer, what proportion of reactions were found in both organisms?
- `consumption_chain_pathway_map`: The ID(s) of the KEGG Pathway Map in which we found the "best" consumption chain. If there are multiple Pathway Maps in a comma-separated list here, it means they all included a consumption chain with the same (maximum) length, (minimum) overlap proportion, and (minimum) overlap length.

If you are curious about the other Pathway Walk evidence for a given prediction, take a look at the 'Evidence' file (described in the next section).

**Additional columns**

Some columns can be added by using particular flags.

- `equivalent_compound_id`: Shows the ModelSEED ID of any compound deemed equivalent to the reported `compound_id`. Added by running the program with either `--use-equivalent-amino-acids` or `--custom-equivalent-compounds-file`.
- `production_rxn_ids_*` and `consumption_rxn_ids_*`: The ModelSEED ID of any production/consumption reactions the compound participates in, specific to the reaction network of a given genome. Added by using the `--add-reactions-to-output` flag.
- `production_rxn_eqs_*` and `consumption_rxn_eqs_*`: The chemical reaction equation of any production/consumption reactions the compound participates in, specific to the reaction network of a given genome. Added by using the `--add-reactions-to-output` flag.

### Pathway Walk evidence for potentially-exchanged compounds

Each line of this file describes the reaction chain evidence for a compound from _one KEGG Pathway Map_, in _one organism_. In each case, we report the _longest_ reaction chain that we could find (rather than reporting all of the many possible chains). If a compound is present in multiple Pathway Maps, each map gets its own line.
