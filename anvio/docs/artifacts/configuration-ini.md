This describes an INI formatted file used to configure a program. 

If you're unsure what the INI format is, you can check out its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file). But it is essentially a text file with sections that defines the values of several keys.

As of now, it is only required in Anvi'o by the program %(anvi-script-gen-short-reads)s, where the file describes various parameters for the short reads that you want to generate, such as the desired length and coverage. Take a look at the page for that program for an example.
