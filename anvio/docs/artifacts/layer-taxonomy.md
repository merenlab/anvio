This is taxonomy information about the layers stored in a %(single-profile-db)s. When you open this %(single-profile-db)s with %(anvi-interactive)s, this information will appear the same way that %(misc-data-layers)s does: in graphs at the right side of the interface, similarly to how the layer names are displayed. 

You can bring this information into your profile database using %(anvi-import-taxonomy-for-layers)s by providing a %(layer-taxonomy-txt)s.
