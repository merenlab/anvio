Essentially, this is the precursor to a %(profile-db)s, containing the results of a single run of %(anvi-profile)s. 

Most likely, you'll want to use this to create a %(profile-db)s, which can be used to run functions like %(anvi-cluster-contigs)s, %(anvi-estimate-metabolism)s, and %(anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases)s. To do this, you'll need to use %(anvi-merge)s. 

However, you can also use this to run %(anvi-import-taxonomy-for-layers)s or view the data stored inside of this using %(anvi-interactive)s.
