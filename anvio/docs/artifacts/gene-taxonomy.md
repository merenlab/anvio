This describes **the taxonomy information for the genes in your %(contigs-db)s**. 

You can use %(anvi-import-taxonomy-for-genes)s to import this information through a %(gene-taxonomy-txt)s, either from external data or by using software like [Kaiju](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/kaiju) or [Centrifuge](https://github.com/infphilo/centrifuge). See [this blog post](http://merenlab.org/2016/06/18/importing-taxonomy/) for a comprehensive tutorial. 

Once this information is populated, it will be displayed in most downstream interfaces, including %(anvi-interactive)s. 

You can also add taxonomy information for the layers in your interface (most likely sections of your sample when analyzing a single sample) using %(anvi-import-taxonomy-for-layers)s, or at the genome or metagenome level using %(anvi-estimate-scg-taxonomy)s.
