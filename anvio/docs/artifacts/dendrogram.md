This described a [NEWICK-formatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) tree that is not representative of the phylogenic relationships between your samples. 

{:.notice}
If you're looking for phylogenic trees, take a look at %(phylogeny)s 

Instead, the dendrogram artifact most often describes the tree used as a %(misc-data-items-order)s: the order that the items in %(anvi-interactive)s are displayed in (the central tree in the circular display). Often, these are the order of your contigs or genes based on their relatedness to each other (for example by tetranucleotide frequency or differencial coverage). These trees are also contained in %(misc-data-layer-orders)s.

A dendrogram is also listed as the output of programs that are not necessarily related to phylogenetics (like %(anvi-matrix-to-newick)s).
