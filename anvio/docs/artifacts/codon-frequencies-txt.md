This file contains **the frequency of each codon in each gene in your %(contigs-db)s.** 

This is a tab-deliminated table where each column represents a codon and each row represents a specific gene. The numbers will either refer to counts of each codon or precent normalizations depending on the parameters with which you ran %(anvi-get-codon-frequencies)s.
