This describes the databases downloaded from [The Genome Taxonomy Database](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) when you run %(anvi-setup-scg-taxonomy)s. 

Once you have these databases, you'll want to search the single-copy core genes in your %(contigs-db)s against them. To do this, run %(anvi-run-scg-taxonomy)s.
