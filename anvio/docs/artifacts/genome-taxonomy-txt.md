This is the output tables that are displayed when you run %(anvi-estimate-scg-taxonomy)s, but formatted as a tab-delimited text file. 

To get this output, just provide the `-o` or the `-O` flag when running %(anvi-estimate-scg-taxonomy)s. 

These contain the exact same information as is normally displayed in the terminal, just in a separate file that is easier to share or include as supplemental data. To see an explination of the data within this file, you can look at the page for %(genome-taxonomy)s.
