A genes-fasta is what it sounds like: a FASTA formatted file that contains genes. In Anvi'o, this is an output for programs that return gene sequences. This includes %(anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-calls)s, %(anvi-get-sequences-for-gene-clusters)s (when working with pan genomes), and %(anvi-get-sequences-for-hmm-hits)s.

If you're unsure what a FASTA file is, check out %(fasta)s.
