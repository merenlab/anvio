The search results for an %(hmm-source)s in a %(contigs-db)s. Essentially, this is the part of an individual %(contigs-db)s that handles the HMM data (In anvi'o, this is usually information about gene annotation). 

Upon creation, a %(contigs-db)s will not contain any HMM results. In order to populate it, users can run %(anvi-run-hmms)s to use a custom or default anvio %(hmm-source)s. The program %(anvi-scan-trnas)s also populates a %(contigs-db)s's hmm-hits.
