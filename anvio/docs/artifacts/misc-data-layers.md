This is the section of your %(profile-db)s/%(pan-db)s that contains custom additional information about each of the layers of the interactive interface (usually displayed as the concentric circles). When you run %(anvi-interactive)s, this data will appear as additional graphs in line with your layers, similar to how the sample names are displayed at the top. 

As also defined in [this blog post](http://merenlab.org/2017/12/11/additional-data-tables/#views-items-layers-orders-some-anvio-terminology), this type of data will include information about each layer of the interface (usually representing your samples). This data can be either numerical or categorical and can be imported into another database by the user through the command %(anvi-import-misc-data)s. 



For example, this information could describe the salinity of a series of ocean samples, the continent your samples were taken in, or which of several collection methods was used.
