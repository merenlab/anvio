When %(anvi-run-interacdome)s is ran, it stores binding frequencies directly into the %(contigs-db)s
as %(misc-data-amino-acids)s. Yet %(anvi-run-interacdome)s also outputs tabular data
directly accessible by the user--this data is what is meant by %(binding-frequencies-txt)s.

Specifically, %(binding-frequencies-txt)s refers to 2 files named `INTERACDOME-match_state_contributors.txt`
and `INTERACDOME-domain_hits.txt` (the `INTERACDOME` part can be changed with `-O`). One day, the
format of these files will be explicitly in this document. Until then, you can find their ouput formats
in [this blogpost](https://merenlab.org/2020/07/22/interacdome/#6-storing-the-per-residue-binding-frequencies-into-the-contigs-database).
Sorry for the inconvenience!
