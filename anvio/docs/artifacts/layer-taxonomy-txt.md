This is a text file containing taxonomy information for your layers (the same information as a %(layer-taxonomy)s). You can bring this information into a %(single-profile-db)s using %(anvi-import-taxonomy-for-layers)s. 

This is a tab-delimited text file that is formatted similarly to a %(gene-taxonomy-txt)s. The first column describes the names of your layers, and the following columns each correspond to the taxonomy level described in the header. Here is an example:

    sample  t_domain    t_phylum    t_class     ...
     c1     Eukaryea    Chordata    Mammalia
     ...
