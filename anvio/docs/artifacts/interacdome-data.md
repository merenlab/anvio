This artifact stores the data downloaded by %(anvi-setup-interacdome)s and is required to run %(anvi-run-interacdome)s.

As described in the [InteracDome blogpost](https://merenlab.org/2020/07/22/interacdome/#anvi-setup-interacdome), this data includes [the tab-separated files](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/#tab-6136-4) from [InteracDome](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/) and the Pfam 31.0 HMMs for the subset of Pfams found in the InteracDome dataset.

By default, this data is stored in `anvio/data/misc/InteracDome`, but a custom path can be set when the user runs %(anvi-setup-interacdome)s if desired.
