This artifact stores the data downloaded by %(anvi-setup-interacdome)s and is required to run
%(anvi-run-interacdome)s. 

As described in the [InteracDome
blogpost](https://merenlab.org/2020/07/22/interacdome/#anvi-setup-interacdome), this data includes
[the tab-separated files](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/#tab-6136-4) from
[InteracDome](https://interacdome.princeton.edu/) and the Pfam 31.0 HMMs for the subset of Pfams
found in the InteracDome dataset.

By default, this data is stored in `anvio/data/misc/InteracDome`, but a custom path can be set when
the user runs %(anvi-setup-interacdome)s if desired.
