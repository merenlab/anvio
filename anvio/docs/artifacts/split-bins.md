This is the result of %(anvi-split-bins)s: self-contained anvi'o projects that contain just the contents of a single %(bin)s from your original database. 

This describes a directory that either contains either a %(genome-storage-db)s and %(pan-db)s (if that's what you gave %(anvi-split-bins)s as an input) or a %(profile-db)s and %(contig-db)s pair. The contigs or genomes and gene clusters described in these databases will be only those contained in the bin that the directory's name corresponds to.
