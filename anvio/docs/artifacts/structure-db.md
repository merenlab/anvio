This database contains the protein structural data for genes in a corresponding %(contigs-db)s and can be generated with %(anvi-gen-structure-database)s.


Currently, this database is best utilized for visualizing 3D structures with %(anvi-display-structure)s.  

For more information on the structure database, see [this blog post](http://merenlab.org/2018/09/04/getting-started-with-anvio-structure/#the-structure-database).
