This contains the taxonomic annotations for each of the tRNA sequences found in your %(contigs-db)s, which are the results of running %(anvi-run-trna-taxonomy)s. 

You can use this information to estimate the taxnomy of genomes, metagenomes, or collections stored in your %(contigs-db)s using the program %(anvi-estimate-trna-taxonomy)s

Recall that this information was calculated using [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/), so it might not be entirely accurate for Eukaryotic tRNAs.
