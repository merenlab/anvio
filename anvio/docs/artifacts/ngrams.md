An %(ngrams) object is a DataFrame that contains count data of synteny patterns collected from a group of similar loci or genomes. It is produced by running %(anvi-analyze-synteny) when given a %(genome-storage) and an annotation source. 

From the anvi'o perspective, an Ngram is a group of N neighboring genes. This object was inspired by kmer count tables but is inherently different because it is counting adjacent genes and not nucleotides. In fact, anvi'o repurposed the term from [linguistics and natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) ;)
