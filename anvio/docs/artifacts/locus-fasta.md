A locus-fasta is one of the outputs of %(anvi-export-locus)s, which creates exports specific regions of interest out of a %(contigs-db)s. 

This artifact specifically describes the %(fasta)s file that contains the sequence of one of the hits to the locus. 

This file is contained within the directory specified by the `-o` parameter and is named with the prefix defined by the `-O` parameter, followed by a numerical identifier for this particular hit. The sequence in this fasta file is also contained in the %(contigs-db)s of the same name.
