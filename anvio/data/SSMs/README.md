This is a directory for _substitution scoring matrices_ for AA and NT engines.

They are utilized to score the competeing AAs or NTs during the variability
profiling step via the program `anvi-gen-variability-profile`.

You can simply put a new matrix file in one of these directories, and they
will be automatically utilized.
