## Purpose of this directory

The purpose of this directory is to keep a miscellaneous collection of HMMs
compatible with `anvi-run-hmms` that are used frequently enough to justify
their inclusion in the codebase for convenience, but not critical enough
for everyone to have them run by default. Models that are considered by
`anvi-run-hmms` by default are stored in `anvio/data/hmms`.

If you add a new source, do not forget to update the contents of dictionary
in `__init__.py`.
