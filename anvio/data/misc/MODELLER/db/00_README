So you need a database, eh? If you go
https://salilab.org/modeller/supplemental.html you can click the download link
named "pdb_95.pir.gz". Download this file into this directory, and unzip it (if
you're on a mac, just double click it and archive utility will do it for you).
Alternatively, just use these command-line commands while in this directory:

$ wget https://salilab.org/modeller/downloads/pdb_95.pir.gz
$ gunzip pdb_95.pir.gz

Now try running your command again :)
