The original Lee collection modified the following way:

Meren removed Ribosomal_S20p, PseudoU_synth_1, Exonuc_VII_S, 5-FTHF_cyc-lig from the collection (as
they were exceptionally redundant or rare), and added Ribosomal_S3_C, Ribosomal_L5, Ribosomal_L2 to
make it more compatible with Hug et al's set of ribosomal proteins.
