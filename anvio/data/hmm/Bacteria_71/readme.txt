The original Lee collection modified the following way:

Meren removed Ribosomal_S20p, PseudoU_synth_1, Exonuc_VII_S, 5-FTHF_cyc-lig, YidD and Peptidase_A8
from the collection (as they were exceptionally redundant or rare among MAGs from various habitats),
and added Ribosomal_S3_C, Ribosomal_L5, Ribosomal_L2 to make it more compatible with Hug et al's
set of ribosomal proteins.
