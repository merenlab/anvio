**If you are reading these lines, it means your test was successful, and your system is able to run anvi'o (yay) :)**

If this is your first time with anvi'o, or if you are not familiar with the platform, please take a moment to read the rest of this document.

### Learning anvi'o

Anvi'o has a relatively steep learning curve, but once you get the basics, the rest comes quite rapidly.

You can start by taking a look at the [anvi'o vignette](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/vignette/) to see all anvi'o programs in a single page along with their help menus. The power of anvi'o comes from its Lego-like design, where a [large number of small programs operate on a small number of concepts](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/network/). This strategy allows you to build very complex ideas in a reproducible and robust fashion.

[This page](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/) offers theoretical and practical insights into 'omics analyses you can perform with anvi'o through tutorials and blog posts. You can also scroll through some of our online reproducible bioinformatics workflows such as [this one](http://merenlab.org/data/prochlorococcus-metapangenome/) or [this one](http://merenlab.org/data/wolbachia-plasmid/) to see various uses of anvi'o in the context of scientific questions.

### Join the conversation

[Developers of anvi'o](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt) strive to tailor this platform to **your** needs. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with us if you need technical help, have suggestions, or simply in need of bouncing computational and experimental 'omics ideas from others. You can join the conversation through [anvi'o slack](https://slackin-ezbpfhwsmh.now.sh/) or [anvi'o Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anvio). If you run into technical problems despite our best efforts, you can always [file an issue report on GitHub](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/issues).
