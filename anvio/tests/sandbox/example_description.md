### Learning anvi'o

Anvi'o has a relatively steep learning curve, but once you get the basics, the rest comes quite rapidly.

* You can start by taking a look at the [anvi'o programs and artifacts](https://merenlab.org/software/anvio/help/main/).

* [Take a look at this short paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-00834-3) to have an idea about the principles behind the platform.
