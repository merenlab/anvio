@dataclass
class Chain:
    """
    Chain of compounds linked by reactions occurring in a KGML representation of a KEGG pathway. The
    chain is contextualized in a reaction network.

    Attributes
    ==========
    kgml_compound_entries : list[kgml.Entry], []
        KGML compound entries linked by kgml_reactions oriented in kgml_reaction_directions.

    is_consumed : bool, None
        True for a "consumption chain" in which the first through the penultimate compounds in the
        chain are consumed by the reactions in the chain. False for a "production chain" in which
        the first through penultimate compounds are produced. A chain is one or the other.

    kgml_reactions : list[kgml.Reaction], []
        KGML reactions linking kgml_compound_entries. Given is_consumed and
        kgml_reaction_directions, one compound entry is a substrate and one is a product of the
        reaction.

    kgml_reaction_directions : list[bool], []
        Items correspond to kgml_reactions, with True indicating the reaction runs as given from
        substrates to products, and False indicating the reaction runs in reverse from products to
        substrates.

    gaps : list[bool], []
        Items correspond to kgml_reactions, with False indicating the reaction is encoded by a KO in
        the reaction network, and True indicating the reaction is not encoded and thus is a gap.

    aliased_modelseed_compounds : list[tuple[anvio.reactionnetwork.ModelSEEDCompound]], []
        Items correspond to kgml_compound_entries. Each item is the tuple of ModelSEED compounds
        aliased by KEGG compound IDs in the name attribute of the KGML compound entry.

    network_kos : list[tuple[anvio.reactionnetwork.KO]], []
        Items correspond to kgml_reactions. Each item is the tuple of KOs in the reaction network
        encoding KEGG reaction IDs in the name attribute of the KGML reaction.

    aliased_modelseed_reactions : list[tuple[anvio.reactionnetwork.ModelSEEDReaction]], []
        Items correspond to kgml_reactions. Each item is the tuple of ModelSEED reactions aliased by
        KEGG reaction IDs in the name attribute of the KGML reaction.

    is_consumption_terminus : bool, None
        This value holds for the first consumed KGML compound in the chain, which is the first
        compound of kgml_compound_entries if is_consumed is True and the last if is_consumed is
        False. KGMLNetworkWalker.check_kgml_compound_entry_consumption_terminus returns True if the
        compound is a consumption terminus and False if not.

    is_production_terminus : bool, None
        This value holds for the last produced KGML compound in the chain, which is the first
        compound of kgml_compound_entries if is_consumed is False and the last if is_consumed is
        True. KGMLNetworkWalker.check_kgml_compound_entry_production_terminus returns True if the
        compound is a production terminus and False if not.

    consumption_reversibility_range : tuple[int, int], None
        Pythonic start and stop indices corresponding to a range of the first consumed KGML
        compounds in the chain, which are the first compounds of kgml_compound_entries if
        is_consumed is True and the last if is_consumed is False. This range indicates compounds
        that are linked by KGML reactions with a type attribute of "reversible". For example, if the
        compound at the beginning of a consumption chain (is_consumed True) is linked to the next
        compound by an irreversible reaction, then the value is (0, 1).

    production_reversibility_range : tuple[int, int], None
        Pythonic start and stop indices corresponding to a range of the last produced KGML compounds
        in the chain, which are the first compounds of kgml_compound_entries if is_consumed is False
        and the last if is_consumed is True. This range indicates compounds that are linked by KGML
        reactions with a type attribute of "reversible". For example, if the compound at the
        beginning of a production chain (is_consumed False) is linked to the next compound by an
        irreversible reaction, then the value is (0, 1).

    Walk chains of compounds linked by reactions in a KGML representation of a KEGG pathway.

    Attributes
    ==========
    kegg_pathway_number : str
        Numerical ID of the pathway to walk. The pathway must have a KEGG reaction (RN) type KGML
        file available. Valid pathways are in categories 1.0 - 1.11 as of the March 3, 2025 release
        of KEGG (see https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).

    kegg_data : anvio.reactionnetwork.KEGGData
        Contains information on an anvi'o KEGG installation, which is assumed to be at the default
        location. A reaction network stored in the network attribute should be constructed from that
        version of the database.

    kgml_rn_pathway : anvio.kgml.Pathway
        Loaded KEGG reaction (RN) type KGML file for the ID number.

    kgml_ko_pathway : anvio.kgml.Pathway
        Loaded KEGG KO type KGML file for the ID number.

    kgml_ec_pathway : anvio.kgml.Pathway
        Loaded KEGG EC number type KGML file for the ID number.

    rn_pathway_kgml_compound_id_to_kgml_reactions : dict[str, list[kgml.Reaction]]
        From the RN type KGML pathway, map KGML compound IDs to the IDs of KGML reactions involving
        the compound as substrate or product.

    pathway_nonenzymatic_kgml_reaction_ids : list[str]
        The RN, KO, and EC type KGML pathways are compared to find nonenzymatic reactions in the RN
        file that are not in the KO or EC files, the KGML IDs of which are recorded in this list.

    rn_pathway_kgml_compound_id_to_kgml_compound_entry : dict[str, list[kgml.Entry]]
        Map KGML compound IDs to the corresponding entries in the RN type pathway.

    ko_pathway_kgml_ortholog_id_to_kgml_ortholog_entry : dict[str, kgml.Entry]
        Map KGML ortholog entry IDs to the corresponding entries in the KO type pathway.

    rn_pathway_kgml_reaction_id_to_ko_ids : dict[str, list[str]]
        Map KGML reaction IDs to KO IDs. The reactions are from the RN type KGML pathway and the KO
        IDs are from the name attribute of a corresponding ortholog entry, if one exists, in the KO
        type KGML pathway.

    contigs_db_path : str, None
        Path to contigs database containing reaction network.

    network : anvio.reactionnetwork.GenomicNetwork, None
        Reaction network that can either be independent of a contigs database (contigs_db_path value
        of None) or associated with a contigs database.

    network_keggcpd_id_to_modelseed_compounds : dict[str, list[rn.ModelSEEDCompound]], {}
        Map the IDs of KEGG compounds (not KGML compound IDs) in the reaction network to aliased
        ModelSEED compounds.

    compound_fate : Literal['consume', 'produce', 'both'], 'both'
        Seek chains that consume or produce compounds in the network. If 'consume' or 'produce',
        only consumption or production chains are sought, respectively. If 'both', both consumption
        and production chains are sought. Chains that only contain reversible reactions are
        therefore found in both directions with 'both'.

    max_reactions : int, None
        Truncate chains at this number of reactions. If None, chains can be continued to
        indeterminate length.

    keep_intermediate_chains : bool, False
        Chains starting from compounds in the network can be subchains of chains from other
        compounds in the network. If False, such intermediate chains are ignored.

    max_gaps : int, 0
        Chains can contain up to this number of reactions not found in the reaction network.

    allow_terminal_gaps : bool, False
        Chains can start or end with reactions not found in the reaction network if True.

    allow_alternative_reaction_gaps : bool, False
        If a chain links two compounds by a reaction in the reaction network, and there are other
        "parallel" KGML reactions not in the reaction network that also link the compounds, then
        treat these parallel reactions as gaps that can be filled when allowing alternative reaction
        gaps with a value of True. Otherwise, with a value of False, ignore parallel reaction gaps.

    run : anvio.terminal.Run, anvio.terminal.Run()
        This object prints run information to the terminal.

    verbose : bool, False
        Print additional runtime information to the terminal, such as reaction network summary
        statistics.

        # 1. Loop through the gaps introduced into new chains. Depending on the input chains (new
        #    more-gapped and old less-gapped), this can be one or more gaps.
        # 2. Inner loop through the new chains containing the gap (or set of gaps). (New chains may
        #    share gap KGML reactions that branch to multiple KGML compounds, yielding multiple
        #    chains sharing the same gaps.)
        # 3. Ignore new chains that, beside gap reactions, contain the same reactions as an old
        #    chain. Gaps in the new chain create "shortcuts" in what is otherwise the same chain.
        # 4. Find the longest contiguous segments of old chains that between them contain the
        #    non-gap reactions of the new chain.
        # 5. Sort the longest contiguous segments in ascending order of length (breaking ties by
        #    index position in the chain). This is the last step in the inner loop.

        #    least one reaction gap involving multiple substrates or products). New chains are
        #    sorted in descending order of contiguous segment length, first considering the shortest
        #    segment from each chain, then the next shortest to break ties, etc. The top-ranking
        #    chain has the longest of the shortest segments.
