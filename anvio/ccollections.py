"""Implements the collections class (the file name has an extra 'c' to avoid
masking the standard collections library).

If the user have analyzed their metagenome using a metagenome binning software
and identified draft genomes in their data (or by any other means binned their
contigs based on any criterion), this information can be stored in the
contigs database's collections_* tables. The class implemented here collects
this information from the database, and presents it as an intuitive data structure
for the client.
