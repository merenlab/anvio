        Entries in 'views' table appear in various places in the interface. However, we also generate
        view tables to store the type of data we do not wish to display on interfaces, but be able
        access from various other modules. A good example to this is the item_order recipes. When we
        profile a sample, we treat every split as its own entity with respect to its mean coverage.
        Although it is great for visualization purposes, it is not useful for item_order purposes since in
        most cases we wish splits to stay together in item_order output. Hence, we create a mean_coverage_splits
        table, where each split holds its own coverage, and we create a mean_coverage_contigs table where each
        split has the coverage of its parent. Clearly the second table is not useful to display. When a table
        is not added as an entry to the 'views' table, then it only exists in the database for other purposes
        than displaying it.

        If a new view does not have a 'view_id', it is not added the 'views' table to provide that flexibility.
