        gene_calls_dict : dict, None
            Alternative to `input_file_path`. If provided, entries will be APPENDED to the database.
            So you need to make sure gene caller ids in your dict does not overlap with the ones in
            the database. Should look like:

                {
                    "1": {

                        "stop": 1544,
                        "direction": "f",
                        "partial": 0,
                        "call_type": 1,
                        "source": "source_name",
                        "version": "unknown",
                        "aa_sequence": "MSKKIYFTEYSKVNRLQTISNFTGSA"
                    },

                    "2": {
                      (...)
                    },

                    (...)
                }

            All entries are required except "aa_sequence", which is optional. If provided, it should
            be present for ALL entries, even if it is an empty string. It's presence will be used to
            populate `gene_amino_acid_sequences`.

        ignore_internal_stop_codons : bool, False
            If False, ConfigError will be raised if a stop codon is found inside any gene. If True,
            this is suppressed and the stop codon is replaced with the character `X`.

        skip_predict_frame : bool, False
            If True, ConfigError will be raised if a gene is not divisible by 3. If False, anvi'o predicts
            the most likley open reading frame and trims the start/stop of the gene call to reflect this
            change so that the gene *is* divisible by 3. This flag allows the retention of amino acid
            sequences even if genes are not divisible by 3, or when it is flagged as partial.

        skip_amino_acid_sequences : bool, False
            Should the gene_amino_acid_sequences table be populated? This may be useful if genes
            that are not translated are being added, such as ribosomal RNA genes, etc.
