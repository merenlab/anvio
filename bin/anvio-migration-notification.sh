echo "This is happening because we had to modernize the anvi'o packaging system, which"
echo "has not been touched for almost 10 years, to catch up with the current Python best"
echo "practices. Previously, we kept anvi'o programs under \`bin/\` and \`sandbox/\`"

echo "environment to track the active codebase (i.e., \`anvio-dev\`), the conda activation"
echo "script had to set PATH variables in your shell pointing to these directories"
echo "so you could execute anvi'o programs directly from those directories in your"
echo "copy of the anvi'o code from GitHub. This strategy worked perfectly fine for"
echo "development, but it conflicted with modern Python packaging standards and created"
echo "issues when anvi'o needed to be installed in non-development environments or"
echo "distributed through standard Python packaging channels. As a result, we decided"
echo "that it was time to bite the bullet and have migrated all 160+ anvi'o programs"
echo "to use what we call 'entry points' -- a modern Python mechanism where programs"
echo "are installed as proper commands. Yes, we know, very fancy indeed ðŸ¥‚"

echo "From now on setting up \`anvio-dev\` environments will use the pip command above,"
echo "rather than hacky means to modify PATH and PYTHONPATH variables. We have updated"
echo "our installation instructions to reflect that. And if you ran the pip command"
echo "above you should be golden: anvi'o programs should be running for you now, and"
echo "you will continue to get the latest anvi'o updates every time you activate your"

echo "also anvi'o developers, any changes you make to the anvi'o Python code will "
