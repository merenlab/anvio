Hi!

If this is a technical issue, please run the command `anvi-self-test --version` in your terminal and paste the output at the beginning of your report.

It would also be very helpful if you can mention which operating system are you using, and how did you install anvi'o.

We thank you in advance for your report, and apologize for screwing things up so badly that you had to do this.

Please don't forget to remove all this text first.
