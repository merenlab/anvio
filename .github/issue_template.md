We thank you in advance for your report. Please take a look at the items down below:

 * If this is a technical issue, please run the command `anvi-self-test --version` in your terminal and paste the output at the beginning of your report. If you fail to do this we will likely close the issue without addressing it, and wait for someone else to report it :(
 
 * Paste your `anvi-self-test --version` output as well as other logs in between ``` characters like this:
 
     ```
     Many many lines
     coming from your logs
     ```

 * If this is a technical issue, please mention which operating system you are using, and how did you install anvi'o. Copy-paste exact command lines you used before observing the error.
 
 * We may need example files to reproduce your issue. Best issues have files to reproduce them. If this is applicable to your case, please make those files available in advance and include direct download links (Dropbox or Google Drive could help).

THIS IS *NOT* A TECHNICAL ISSUE
