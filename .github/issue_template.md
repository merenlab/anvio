PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR ISSUE
=============================================

IS THIS A TECHNICAL ISSUE?
---------------------------------------------
Please first ask yourself whether this is a technical issue, or you are here because you need help to figure out how to use anvi'o for a particular purpose.

THIS IS NOT A TECHNICAL ISSUE
---------------------------------------------
That's OK. We are more than happy to help. But GitHub Issues is not the right place for those questions. Instead, please use our Slack channel, or anvi'o Google Groups to send your question. You can get an invitation to our Slack channel from here: https://slackin-ezbpfhwsmh.now.sh/

THIS IS A TECHNICAL ISSUE
---------------------------------------------
We thank you in advance for your report, and apologize for screwing things up so badly that you had to do this:

 * If this is a technical issue, please run the command `anvi-self-test --version` in your terminal and paste the output at the beginning of your report. If you fail to do this we will likely close the issue without addressing it, and wait for someone else to report it :(

 * If this is a technical issue, please mention which operating system you are using, and how did you install anvi'o.

 * Remove this text before submitting your issue.


Thanks,
