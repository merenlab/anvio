We thank you in advance for your report, and apologize for screwing things up so badly that you had to do this:

- If this is a technical issue, please run the command `anvi-self-test --version` in your terminal and paste the output at the beginning of your report. If you fail to do this we will likely close the issue without addressing it, and wait for someone else to report it :(
