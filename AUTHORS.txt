Anvi'o is an open-source, community-driven project and the purpose of this file is
to mention names who contributed to its codebase. The file divides individuals into
two main groups: (1) those that are currently employed the University of Chicago
and work on anvi'o as a part of their job description (hence they are ready to
respond to technical questions or work on feature requests), and (2) those who who
contribute (or have contributed) to the platfrom from elsewhere on a voluntary
basis. The order of names in this file follows the logic implemented at GitHub's
contributors page at https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/graphs/contributors, which
ranks indivisuals based on the number of commits they've made to the anvi'o master
repository. This list of names do not include those who contributed to the platform
by submitting issue reports, writing tutorials, or making suggestions.

Anvi'o developers are aware of the fact that there are no simple quantitative
measures that can serve as fair and accurate judges of importance or quality. If
you are a user of anvi'o and found yourself all the way here reading these lines, we
wish you to remind yourself that the order of names in this file means nothing more
than a poor attempt to have an organization based on a rather neutral metric. If you
are an anvi'o user, we believe that it would be the most appropriate and kind of you
to assume that each and every individual here has contributed to anvi'o equally.
Since you are here, we thank you, too.
