Anvi'o is an open-source, community-driven project and the purpose of this file is
to mention names who contributed to its codebase. The file divides individuals into
two main groups: (1) those who are currently employed at the University of Chicago
and work on anvi'o as a part of their job description (hence they are ready to
respond to technical questions or work on feature requests), and (2) those who
contribute (or have contributed) to the platform and help (or have helped) its
progress from elsewhere. The order of names in this file follows the logic
implemented at GitHub's contributors page at the following URL, which ranks
individuals based on the number of commits they've made to the anvi'o master
repository:

    https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/graphs/contributors

Anvi'o developers are aware of the fact that there are no simple quantitative
measures that can serve as fair and accurate judges of importance or quality. For
instance this list does not include those who contributed to the platform by submitting
issues, writing tutorials, making suggestions, or helping other anvi'o users.

If you are a user of anvi'o and found yourself all the way here reading these lines, we
would like you to remind yourself that the order of names in this file means nothing
more than a poor attempt to have an organization based on a rather neutral metric. If
you are an anvi'o user, we believe that it would be the most appropriate and kind of
you to assume that anvi'o wouldn't have been possible without any of these individuals
and those who contributed to the platfrom by other means than writing code. We are
thankful for all who invested their time. Since you are here, we thank you, too.
